export.py — fetch thehenley.com.au and write a static, self-contained copy.

The output is the website. Not a source for one: the HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Elementor produced are kept exactly as served, because the whole point of this
stream is that the public cannot tell the difference. What changes is listed
in docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-16-legacy-replica-design.md §3 and §4 and
implemented, one rule per function, below.

    forms/.venv/bin/python replica/export.py            # writes replica/site and replica/manifest.json
    forms/.venv/bin/python replica/export.py --out /tmp/x --manifest /tmp/x.json

Standard library only, so it runs with any Python 3.11+ on the host.
